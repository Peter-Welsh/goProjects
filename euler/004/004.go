Project Euler problem number 4 (https://projecteuler.net/problem=4)

Largest palindrome product

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
