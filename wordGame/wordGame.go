/*
This program is a word game similar to Wordle.
The user enters the length of the word, and the program generates a random word of that length.
The user then guesses words until they get it correct.
After each guess, the program displays clues to help the user arrive at the answer.
A letter in the correct spot will yield a green square
A letter in the word but not in the right spot will yield a yellow square.
A letter that is not in the word at all will yield a black square.

Note:
- The program needs to be run in a console that prints in a font that supports full-color UTF8 characters
- The program was developed and tested on the VS Code terminal
- To give up, you can type !q when prompted for a guess
- To play a game with a word length other than 5, pass the length as a command line argument like so: "go run wordgame.go -l x" (where x is a positive integer)

Limitations:
- The program relies on a specific external API to get the hidden word and will not function if that API is unavailable.
- The program relies on a dictionary API (defined in ../dictionary) which may not have the definition

Possible improvements:
- add a graphical keyboard to show which letters have been eliminated
- keep track of best scores
- check if the user's guess is a real word rather than allowing any random letters
- make the word length a command-line argument
- support consoles that don't have unicode support by displaying clues in ASCII (e.g. G/Y/B for Green Yellow Black)
